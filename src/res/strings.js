    title: 'Frequently Asked Questions',
    question1: 'How Do I Listen For A Wave?',
    answer1: 'To receive a wave within the browser, navigate to the receive screen. You must activate the browser to listen for a wave by clicking \'Press Me to Listen for A Wave\' before the other user clicks send. The text in the container box will change according to the current status. If your wave has successfully arrived, it will be displayed in the container.',
    question2: 'How Do I Send A Wave?',
    answer2: 'To send a wave within the browser, navigate to the send screen. Enter a message or upload a file/image, click send once you are done. If your message or file/image is successfully sent, you will hear the sound of bird chirping.',
    question3: 'Why Is Wave Not Working?',
    answer3: 'First, check to ensure that you have an internet connection. If Wave continues to not work and there are no error messages displayed, contact us!',
    question4: 'Why Should I Use Wave Over AirDrop/Bluetooth Or Other File Transferring Tools?',
    answer4: 'Wave is device agnostic, meaning that you can send and receive from any device, unlike AirDrop. Also, Wave supports sending data from one device to infinitely other devices all at the same time.',
    question5: 'Do I Need An Internet Connection to Use Wave?',
    answer5: 'For standard Waves, yes you do need an internet connect. However, Wave also supports offline mode with a maximum of 32 characters being sent.',
    question6: 'Why Is There A Maximum Length to The Text I Can Send For Offline Mode?',
    answer6: 'The 1000 character limit is to ensure that Waves are not too large. The 32 character limit on offline Waves is in place so that the Wave that is played is not too long.',
    question7: 'Does the Person Receiving My Wave Need to Have the App Installed?',
    answer7: 'We suggest installing the Wave app for a better experience, but using the browser version on mobile devices works as well.',
    question8: 'How Secure is Wave?',
    answer8: 'Since anyone can pickup the sound waves that your Wave emits, Wave is not a secure method of sending data. We will add password protected Waves in the future for sending secure data.',
    question9: 'How Many Devices Can I Send to at Once?',
    answer9: 'You can send to as many devices as you would like at once, as long as the devices receiving are on the receive screen.'
